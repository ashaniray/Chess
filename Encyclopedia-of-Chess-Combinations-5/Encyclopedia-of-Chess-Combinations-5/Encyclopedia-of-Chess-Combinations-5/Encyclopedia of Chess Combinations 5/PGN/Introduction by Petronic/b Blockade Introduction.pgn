{Diagram [#]  Black to play.     White is up a bishop for a pawn, thus it is
time for Black to consider either resignation, or - a blockade?(!) Since the
white king has only one legal square available, Black takes it away. This
produces a situation where a checkmate is possible on either the next move or
a later move.} 1... h4 $1 $19 {By denying the h4-square to the white king,
Black is winning. In large part this is possible in view of the self-blockaded
white bishop and rooks. Checkmate on the next move is unstoppable:} 2. Rh2 Rh5#
